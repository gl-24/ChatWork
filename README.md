## Background
“The social media phase of the Internet ended,” declared Fred Wilson—a leading venture capitalist and early investor in Twitter, Foursquare, and Tumblr—in his 2014 “What Just Happened?” year-in-review. He continued:

> Entrepreneurs and developers still build social applications. We still use them. But there isn't much innovation here anymore…messaging is the new social media…families use WhatsApp groups instead of Facebook. Kids use Snapchat instead of Instagram. Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp in February of this year was the transaction that defined this trend.

## Introduction
